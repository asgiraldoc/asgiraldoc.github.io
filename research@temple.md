### A Tale of Two Clades: The Deep Evolutionary Divergence of Human Malarias
<p align="justify">
The two most significant human malaria parasites, <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and <i>P. falciparum</i>, exhibit vast biological differences, from their life cycles to the diseases they cause. This review addresses the fundamental question: why are they so different? We explain that their unique traits are rooted in a deep evolutionary divergence that occurred millions of years ago. Each parasite belongs to a distinct clade—the subgenus <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Laverania</i>, respectively—which originated in Africa but followed different evolutionary paths. As part of my contribution to this work, I performed the phylogenomic analyses that underpin this evolutionary narrative. I reconstructed the species tree from over 1,028 single-copy genes, providing a robust framework to visualize the ancient split between these lineages and to contextualize the major molecular adaptations, such as key differences in red blood cell invasion pathways and antigenic variation, that define each group. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-022-04130-9" target="_blank">[Publication]</a>

### Uncovering Hidden Parasite Diversity in Turtles Through Genomics
<p align="justify">
The diagnosis of blood parasites like <i>Haemogregarina</i> has traditionally been limited by morphology and the use of slow-evolving molecular markers like 18S rDNA, which often fail to resolve closely related species. This project's main goal was to overcome this limitation by developing novel, faster-evolving mitochondrial markers. My role was to execute the crucial bioinformatic pipeline that formed the foundation of this study. Starting with over one billion raw sequencing reads obtained from an infected turtle sample, I performed the pre-processing and quality control, filtered out the host's genomic data, and conducted the <strong><i>de novo</i> assembly</strong> of the parasite's mitochondrial genome fragments. These assembled sequences provided the essential blueprint for designing novel primers for the <i>coxI</i>, <i>coxIII</i>, and <i>cytb</i> genes. Ultimately, these new tools proved highly effective, uncovering a vast and previously hidden genetic diversity among these parasites. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.105040" target="_blank">[Publication]</a>
