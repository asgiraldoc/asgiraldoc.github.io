## About me

<p align="justify"> **My story:** I was born and raised in Bogot√°-Colombia. Since I was a child, I have always been interested in science, mainly in astronomy. Every time I looked at the sky, I was amazed by the immensity of the universe. One day my mother brought home some frogs that she had found on the road, and from that moment, I began to pursue my dream of being a scientist (biologist). When I finished high school, I began to build my way of studying my degree in Biology at the National University of Colombia. During this time, I was part of the research group GERPH, where I learned a lot about parasitology, molecular biology, and ecology. Later, I was accepted as a master's student at the same University, where I completed and published my thesis entitled "<a href="https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/75759">Characterization of the genome of *Haemoproteus* (*Haemoproteus*) *columbae*: as a tool for the evolutionary study of the order Haemosporida</a>" under the direction of Dr. Matta. With this thesis, I obtained a laureate mention. After graduation, I decided to continue with my dream. Now I am a Ph.D. student in Biology at Temple University, under the direction of Dr. Escalante, working on comparative genomics and population genetics in *Plasmodium* spp.
