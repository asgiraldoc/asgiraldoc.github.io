## About me

### My Story
<p align="justify"> I was born and raised in Bogot√°-Colombia. Since I was a child, I have always been interested in science, mainly in astronomy. Every time I looked at the sky, I was amazed by the immensity of the universe. One day my mother brought home some frogs that she had found on the road, and from that moment, I began to pursue my dream of being a scientist (biologist). When I finished high school, I began to build my way of studying my degree in Biology at the National University of Colombia. During this time, I was part of the research group GERPH, where I learned a lot about parasitology, molecular biology, and ecology. Later, I was accepted as a master's student at the same University, where I completed and published my thesis entitled "<a href="https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/75759">Characterization of the <i>Haemoproteus</i> (<i>Haemoproteus</i>) <i>columbae</i> genome: as a tool for the evolutionary study of the Haemosporida order</a>" under the direction of Dr. Matta. With this thesis, I obtained a laureate mention. After graduation, I decided to continue with my dream. Now I am a Ph.D. student in Biology at Temple University, under the direction of Dr. Escalante, working on comparative genomics and population genetics in <i> Plasmodium </i> spp.

### More on me
<p align="justify">  I have found that all things have their positive and negative sides throughout my life, so I have always tried to explore all kinds of things. For example, my musical tastes range from death-gore metal to Colombian folk music. Likewise, with sports, I am passionate about chess and soccer (my team is Millonarios FC). Also, I've always considered myself a voracious reader of philosophy, fantasy, and classic literature. However, my brain shuts down entirely when I've tried to explore genres such as self-improvement or pseudo-science.
  
Finally, I have been interested in tattoos for a few years now. I currently have 16 tattoos that represent my experiences, my beliefs, my tastes. In short, my body is now a book where I write my life.
