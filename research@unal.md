## My Research at UNAL

### 1. Standardization of molecular biology protocols (heamoparasite diagnosis)

<p align="justify">  This project succeeded in standardizing multiplex PCR assays to diagnose coinfections of heamoparasites that infect birds, achieving 79.4% of the total number of coinfections when confirmed host DNA integrity. It also provided preliminary results to increase the resolution of phylogenetic hypotheses using new mitochondrial markers. </p>

### 2. Animal model and life cycle characterization of *Haemoproteus columbae*

<p align="justify">  The main aims of this study were: i) to develop a useable methodology to carry out experimental research with <i>H. columbae</i> using its natural avian host (the Rock Pigeon) and its vector (louse fly) and ii) to follow the complete life cycle of <i>H. columbae</i> (cytb lineage HAECOL1) in experimentally infected insects and birds. </p>

### 3. *Haemoproteus columbae* apicoplast genome

<p align="justify">  <i>Haemoproteus</i> shares a recent common ancestor with <i>Plasmodium</i> compared to other known Haemosporida such as the genus <i>Leucocytozoon</i>. In this sense, the <i>H. columbae</i> apicoplast genome is important since it can be used, for instance, in phylogenetic analyses as an outgroup for the <i>Plasmodium-Hepatocystis</i> clade. In addition to reporting the first <i>Haemoproteus</i> apicoplast genome, this new genome is used to reconstruct phylogenetic hypotheses within the order Haemosporida. </p>
