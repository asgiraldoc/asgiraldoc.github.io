  In January 2021, I started my Ph.D. under the guidance of Dr. Ananias A. Escalante at Temple University. Research at the Escalante Lab focuses on the ecology, epidemiology and evolution of infectious diseases. I am interested in establishing bridges among population genetics, ecological, and evolutionary biology perspectives by interpreting genomic patterns from pathogens (mainly in <i> Plasmodium </i> spp.) and integrating them with environmental or epidemiologic information.
