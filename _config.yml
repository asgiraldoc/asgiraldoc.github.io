  In January 2021, I started my Ph.D. under the guidance of Dr. Ananias A. Escalante at Temple University. Research at the Escalante Lab focuses on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. I am interested in establishing bridges among population genetics, ecological, and evolutionary biology perspectives by interpreting genomic patterns from pathogens (mainly in <i> Plasmodium </i> spp.) and integrating them with environmental or epidemiologic information.

  I completed my master's degree at the National University of Colombia, working with Dr. Nubia Matta. My research focused on characterizing the first genome of the parasite genus <i> Haemoproteus </i>  (subgenus <i> Haemoproteus</i>). However, my approach to this study included standardization of the animal model, description of the parasite life cycle in both vector and vertebrate hosts, and evolutionary analyses including this parasite genome.
